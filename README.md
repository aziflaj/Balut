# Balut

This is a homework project developed in the Object-Oriented Programming subject while studying Computer Engineering at Polytechnic University of Tirana. You can find the description of the application in the wiki (Albanian only).

The application uses Gradle as the build system, so you can run the application by executing:

```bash
$ ./gradlew run -q
```

Or if you are using Windows:

```
>_ gradlew run -q
```
